# Crypto.ZK.AnonymousCredentialsExample

Minimal example model backing the `anonymousCredentialsCorrectness` ZK
property.

This model abstracts away cryptographic details and focuses on the
shape of a ZK proof for anonymous credentials:

* correctness: whenever the verifier accepts a proof, the revealed
  attributes correspond to some credential in the registry; and
* anonymity: the verifier's decision depends only on attributes and
  the registry, not on the holder identity.

It is deliberately small and assumption-free, providing a clear target for
the spec-level statement in `Crypto.ZK.Spec`.
