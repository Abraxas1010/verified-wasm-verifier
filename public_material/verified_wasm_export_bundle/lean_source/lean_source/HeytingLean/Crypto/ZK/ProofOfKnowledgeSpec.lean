# Proof-of-knowledge (PoK) interface (spec-only)

This file defines a small, relation-based proof-of-knowledge interface with **soundness**.
It is intentionally proof-light and makes no cryptographic security claims (e.g. ZK, HVZK,
extractability under PPT assumptions, etc.).

We also provide a trivial, assumption-free constructor: the “proof” *is* the witness.
